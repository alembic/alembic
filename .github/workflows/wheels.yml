name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
#     branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
#     branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Use the alembic build action of this repo
      - uses: ./.github/actions/build-manylinux

      # Upload wheel as artifact
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: wheel
          path: dist/*-manylinux*.whl
