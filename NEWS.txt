2011-02-17, Alembic 0.9.2:

This is somewhere between a major and minor update.  Numerous bugs
have been fixed, some new functionality has been introduced, and
reference Maya plugins for import and export have been added.

The code changes can be examined here:

http://codereview.appspot.com/4160045/

Some highlights in functionality:

 - Maya export and import plugins are in the top-level "maya" directory.

 - In the top-level "python" directory is the beginning of Python bindings
   using Boost.Python.  This effort is currently incomplete, but with
   these bindings, the structure of an Alembic Archive can be examined.

 - UVs on PolyMeshes and SubD meshes, as well as Normals on PolyMeshes,
   are included in their definition, and can be written and read as
   indexed arrays or expanded, non-indexed arrays, with automatic
   interconversion between the two representations.

As this is still a 0.9 release, it is still to be considered Beta, and
should not be used for critical, deadline-driven production work.

Also as usual, feedback and questions are welcome!  The main discussion list
is low-traffic, but anyone can sign up and participate:

2010-12-13, Alembic 0.9.1:

Just a minor update to enable Alembic on 32-bit systems, along with
getting the code in examples/bin/AbcEcho reasonably working.

2010-12-08, Alembic 0.9.1:

The main things in this release are the addition of a Renderman procedural
plugin, and a bunch of bug fixes.  The example Maya exporter
(AlembicSimpleAbcExport) can be used to create an Alembic file from a Maya
scene, and that Alembic file can be read by the Renderman plugin to create
images, which means that an end-to-end workflow can be achieved.  A complete
overview of the changes to the code is here:

A summary of the bugs fixed in this change:

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=71

An internal implementation detail that fixed an issue where files created by
the AlembicSimpleAbcExport Maya plugin were invalid.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=118

Another internal implementation bugfix that ensured that certain properties of
a subdivision surface were properly animatable.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=17

Method to return a Property's parent Object simply did not work.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=121

Methods to determine high-level type now more flexible and correct.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=7

Build system improvement; now behaves better when trying to find the Boost
headers and libraries.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=13

A consequence of the bug that was fixed in issue 71.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=123

Alembic was not reading all the required data from an ISimpleXform.


In progress, we have:

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=102

This is an arbitrary transform "stack" type, roughly equivalent to Renderman's
transformation model.  It has per-operation hints that allow it to be
recognized as a transform and mapped directly to another application's
transformation model.  It can also be read and written as a regular 4x4
matrix.
