2013-9-18, Alembic 1.5.1
Hello Alembic users, thanks to your feedback we have another collection of
small but useful bug fixes and enhancements to the API, some of the example
tools, and the Maya plugins.

API:

IXform/OXform:
Make default identity xforms use even less disk space.
Fix for Issue 313: IXformSchema::getInheritsXforms() crash with no samples

Python bindings:
Fix for Issue 308: ILightSchema.getCameraSchema() segfaults when no cameras
are available

Maya:

AbcImport:
Fix for Issue 311: properly set SubD creases, corners, and holes when the
geometry is animated

Fix for Issue 312: AbcImport doesn't accept long names when filtering

AbcExport:
Ogawa is now written out by default. (when the -dataformat flag isn't specified)

Multiple frame ranges can be specified for more control over the samples
exported.

-preRoll flag was added for specified frame ranges that you want evaluated but
not exported.

Misc Tools:

AbcLs - fix bugs, added new flag -s to view the size of a scalar or array
property, -t for printing time info of the archive and the time a sample
index of a property corresponds to.  -f prints out the frame assuming 24fps.

AbcView - tweaked docs, lots of bug fixes, better camera support

prman Procedural - Fix for Issue 314: subdiv tags could become corrupted.

##-*****************************************************************************

2013-7-22, Alembic 1.5.0
Hello Alembic users, we are pleased to announce the official release of a new
data back end for Alembic, codenamed Ogawa with improved write, read, and
especially multi-threaded read performance.

Here are some improvements we are seeing with this version:

1) File sizes are on average 5-15% smaller. Scenes with many small objects
should see even greater reductions.

2) Single-threaded reads average around 4x faster

3) Multi-threaded reads can improve by 25x (relative to the same operations in
the existing HDF5 back-end) on 8 core systems.

We are maintaining backwards compatibility, and you will be able to continue to
read and write Alembic files backed by HDF5.

Other library features added:

Support for explicit hierarchical deduplication. (OObject::addChildInstance)

Hierarchical hash keys added to objects, making it easier to compare sub-graphs
of various archives. (IObject::getPropertiesHash, IObject::getChildrenHash)

Add AbcCoreFactory::IFactory class which is a convenience class for determining
whether an archive is backed by HDF5 or Ogawa and returning a properly
instantiated IArchive.  All of the readers in the repository have been updated
to use this.

Python bindings have been extended to support the new features above.

New utility:

abcls this utility is meant to behave like ls or h5ls and offers an
inexpensive way to explore your object and property hierarchies.

Bug fixes:

ICamera:
Getting the film back xform channels needs to be done by index.
Animated film back data wasn't being reflected in isConstant.
Offset data should be applied after the filmback matrix.

AbcExport: preScale, and postScale film back xform should be 1.0/scale.

##-*****************************************************************************

2013-4-11, Alembic 1.1.5
Hello Alembic users, thanks to your feedback we have another collection of
small but useful bug fixes and performance enhancements for the Maya plugins.

AbcExport:

Improve the performance of util::isAnimated.

If MFnIkJoint's Scale Compensate is off, [IS] is ignored otherwise multiply it
after [T].  [IS] is actually the inverse of the inverseScale plug.

Fixed const related error caught by Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0 compiler.

AbcImport:

Use createPoint and createColor for MFnNumericAttribute when appropriate.

##-*****************************************************************************

2013-03-25, Alembic 1.1.4
Hello Alembic users, thanks to your feedback we have another collection of
small but useful and important bug fixes.

Fix several multi-platform issues to making compiling in Windows and OSX easier.

PyAlembic:

Fix typo XformSample::getZRotation should be XformSample::getScale.

AbcImport:

Directly set the string plug, as the default value is not saved to the Maya
file and thus is not restored.

AbcExport/AbcImport:

Fix bug where the conversion from shutter open, shutter close to shutter angle
was being improperly scaled.

##-*****************************************************************************

2013-02-11, Alembic 1.1.3
Hello Alembic users, thanks to your feedback we have another collection of
useful features and bug fixes.

Alembic library:

Add missing setTimeSampling member function to OCurves and ONuPatch. (Issue 295)

Record the max number of samples written for various TimeSampling at the
archive level, and provide a utility function for getting the start and end time
of the archive using this data.  (Issue 301)

Propogate the Error handling policy better.

Add Box2(s,i,f,d) array properties to match scalar properties.

INuPatch getTopologyVariance wasn't correctly taking into account animated
weights.

IsAncestorVisible utility function was returning the wrong value.

TimeSamplingType now allows for some floating point imprecision during
comparison. (Issue 301)

Add isStandardName and makeStandardName convenience functions.

    - These functions offer plugin writers an easy way to get multi-application
      name compliance.  They help you convert any special characters your
      application supports into a set universally accepted characters.

Add AbcOpenGL library which is based on the draw code from SimpleAbcViewer.

Python:

Add PyAbcOpenGL bindings.

Fix segfault with invalid getProperty index/name

Add getProperty to OCompoundProperty

Add getKey to IArrayProperty

    - This is the preferred way to get the alembic hash of a property.
      Previously you needed to build the a hash by marshalling
      and serializing the data in python which is slooow.

Add getMaxNumSamplesForTimeSamplingIndex to IArchive.

Add high level Python API named "cask" built on top of the Alembic Python
bindings.

    - This was developed to simplify scripting of alembic files
      in Python.

    - It is designed to be easy to use and "Pythonic". For example it
      gives you a dictionary style interface to objects and
      properties.

    - It is an abstraction on top of alembic which allows you to create mutable
      objects. This means scripters are not forced to use the separated,
      immutable input and output core alembic objects.

    - We will host documentation on docs.alembic.io shortly but for now please
      convert the cask.rst file in python/examples/cask/doc to read the docs
      and see examples.

Add abcview which uses PyQt and PyAbcOpenGL

    - This tool is perfect for debugging alembic caches. It offers Katana-
      style, lazy-UI hierarchy traversal and a script editor to do more 
      in-depth object and property queries using the Python bindings.
      SimpleAbcView is embedded into the application for easy reference.

Bootstrap and CMake:

Fix boost configuration if you are not building pyalembic. (Issue 296)

Eliminate many warnings when compiling with Visual Studio 10. (Issue 294)

Improve many of our CMakeLists.txt so that you can use Cmake directly instead
of having to go through the bootstrap.

Better Windows compliance. (Look for further improvements over the next releases).

Maya:

AbcExport bounding box calculation for the entire archive is much more efficient
and is especially noticeable when calculating bounds on deep hierarchies.

Add identifyFile and haveNamespaceSupport to AlembicImportFileTranslator.

Fix bug where the AlembicImportFileTranslator could not be unloaded properly.

Arnold Procedural:

Fix bug with multiple samples potentially being added for uvlist.

Initialize makeInstance on creation.

Add instanced nodes to the list of createdNodes.

Utilities:

Add abctree which walks the entire hierarchy and prints out the names
of objects.

##-*****************************************************************************

2012-10-17, Alembic 1.1.2
Hello Alembic users, thanks to your feedback we have another collection of
small but useful features and bug fixes.

New features:

Maya AbcImport:

Added inclusive and exclusive filtering support to allow selective importing
of cache objects via regex matches.

Added file translator support. Alembic caches can now be opened directly and
imported as Maya references.

Facesets now get imported as Maya facesets instead of an integer array
attribute.

Maya AbcExport:

Write out curves with a basis of b-spline and repeat first and last
points twice (if they aren't repeated) if we have a cubic open curve.

Support exporting Maya facesets with the -wfs/-writefacets flag.

Add -ef/-eulerFilter flag which euler filters samples to rotate, rotate axis,
and joint orient.

Update -sn/-stripNamespaces flag with an optional integer to only strip
that number of namespaces.

Remove boost usage.

Core library:

Add static emptySample() convenience function.

Improve const correctness on most of the Abc and AbcGeom getter functions.

Child bounds are no longer written and read via the schema's sample class,
instead the child bounds property is directly exposed on the schema.

Normals and UVs IGeomParams are no longer returned by reference.

On Xforms, only write the .animChans data once if necessary.

Bug fixes:

Maya AbcImport:

Clean up temporary trim curves when the trim operation fails for 
MFnNurbsSurface.

##-*****************************************************************************

2012-9-20, Alembic 1.1.1
Hello Alembic users, thanks to your feedback we have another collection of
small but useful and important bug fixes.

Bug fixes:

Issue 291
Fix for some compile issues/warnings on Windows.

Issue 292
Hash keys are being computed incorrectly on Windows.

Some small CMake updates.

Fixed typo in OSubD::setHoles

##-*****************************************************************************

2012-7-26, Alembic 1.1.0

Hello Alembic users.  We are excited to announce another release of Alembic
which contains many new features, bug fixes and performance improvements.

What's new:

- AbcCollections. Alembic now supports the concept of a collection.  Sometimes
people refer to collections as "groups" or "object sets" (as in Maya).

- AbcMaterial.  Alembic now supports the concept of a material. This is done by
defining a schema for a material definition which can act as a standalone object
or as supplemental data attached to another object. AbcMaterial also defines
conventions and utilities for binding and resolving marterial assignments 
and overrides. We have not gone as far as defining what a material schema should
actually contain (as we did with cameras); instead we allow you to define your
own material "target" to allow all the many variations in material standards
that exist today. However we have reserved the name "abc" for a target
we will define at a later time; the hope is that this material target would
become the standard for material interchange.

- AbcLight. Alembic now supports the concept of a light. Light objects are 
distinct objects that contain both a camera and a material schema.  The material
on the light controls the shader parameters associated with the light and the
camera can contain all relevant camera-like light information.

- Python bindings.  At long last the Alembic team has finally completed the
python bindings to allow scripters to access the full power of the alembic
c++ api. All the new features listed above as well as the layers Abc though 
AbcGeom are bound. The base bindings of typed data (including typed arrays) 
are pyimath types so if your program can natively create imath data types 
there is no performance penalty to convert to and from alembic types.

- Performance optimization. When we profiled Alembic we found that, for some
caches, a great deal of time was being spent in HDF5 functions that access
groups and attributes by name.  We now let you optionally write a side car
datastructure within the HDF5 file that maps the HDF5 hierarchy to HDF5 object
references which results in lookups that are  much faster. You pay the price
of a slight disk size increase and memory footprint.

- Maya plugin updates. The ".userProperties" compound property that is available
on most Alembic objects is now supported for both read and write with full 
support for animated values. Additional parameters have also been added to the 
AlembicNode to allow cache retiming along with support for loop, reverse and
bounce.

- Boost removal from the core. We are no longer dependent on boost to give us
an implementation of a shared pointer (for example) so we were able to remove 
the dependency on boost while building the core library.

Bug Fixes:

Issue 171:
OScalar and OArray Properties had a scoping issue when parented to the immediate
child compound property of an OObject.

Issue 245:
I<type>GeomParam would match to properties that aren't geom params.
IArrayProperty is always considered a geom param with constant scope.

Issue 253-255
Several bugs involved with the -rm flag on AbcImport have been fixed.

Issue 263
AbcExport UV write fix, loop over all faces, not just the faces which have UVs.

Issue 275
AddGeomToParamListBuilderAsFloat was calculating wrong boundary for the
IV2fArrayProperty.

Issue 280
Accomodate Unicode file names in AbcImport and AbcExport.

Issue 285
AbcGeom/Basis.h was not including Alembic/Util/Foundation.h

##-*****************************************************************************

2012-2-14, Alembic 1.0.5

Bug fix release.

Fix for issue 272.

Core:

String dimensions weren't being written correctly for string arrays when copying
a previous sample.

Correctness updates to "matches(..)" (data matching functions).

Houdini plugin:
Reverting frame - 1 change.
Including a clear cache function.

##-*****************************************************************************

2012-1-12, Alembic 1.0.4

Hello, Alembic users, thanks to your feedback we have another collection of
API additions and small but useful bug fixes.

Some highlights:

API:

 - Now supports raw reads, and reading as a different precision, for array properties
 via a new method getAs (). Currently strings, wstrings, and float16_t
 can not be read as any other type.

 - Added an optional velocity property to polymeshes, subds, nurbs, and curves.
 Velocity is considered to be in units per second.

 - Added a temporary work around for an HDF5 bug where parts of the file could become
 corrupt. This workaround always stores the HDF5 links in dense storage.  This can lead to
 larger file sizes when you have a lot of IObjects.

 - Improved the performance on partial hierarchy traversal by deferring opening of an
 object's HDF5 group until truly needed.

Renderman Procedural:

 - Added support for V3dGeomParam, P3dGeomParam, and BoolGeomParam

Houdini SOP:

 - Dramatically increased the performance under Houdini 12 and pleasantly increased
 performance under 11.1.

Maya AbcImport:

 - Don't interpolate when the time values closely match the ceiling value.

 - Don't create a new color set every time an animated color set is evaluated.

 - Interpolating non indexed color values would sometimes cause a crash.

We welcome your comments on the discussion list.

##-*****************************************************************************

2011-11-11, Alembic 1.0.3

Hello, Alembic users, thanks to your feedback we have another collection of
small but useful bug fixes to our plugins.

Some highlights:

Renderman Procedural:

 - Addition of Windows export information for ConvertParameters/Subdivide/Free

 - Fixed an uninitialized variable for -flipv

 - Fixed a string-related memory bug for declarations in ParamListBuilder
(issue 241)

 - Addition of support for reading, caching and sharing argument strings from
files.

 - Addition of support for restoring named resource blocks at specified paths
or names for objects and facesets

 - Fixed support for getInheritsXforms in IXforms (issue 247)

 - Fixed CMake where it failed to find libprman.lib because of a typo
(issue 229)

Maya AbcImport:

 - Fixed compilation with Maya 2011 by adding an ifdef for the
setDisplayColors(true) call.  (issue 244)

 - Fixed some issues with the -connect option.  Transforms weren't being
properly cleared when connection.

Maya AbcExport:

 - Change for FBIK joints, there isn't always a connection to translate or
scale (like rotate for IK joints).  We now treat them like they are animated.

 - Return an error if the file can't be written to.

 - The full -renderableOnly flag was not properly being detected (issue 252)

We welcome your comments on the discussion list.

##-*****************************************************************************

2011-10-12, Alembic 1.0.2

Hello, Alembic users, thanks to your feedback we have another collection of
small but useful bug fixes and a couple of new flags for some of our plugins.

Some highlights:

- In Maya don't flip V when reading and writing UVs. (AbcExport and AbcImport)

- Add a flag (-flipv) to the prman Procedural to flip V when necessary.

- Add a flag (-wcs / -writeColorSets) to AbcExport to write out color sets and
restore them on AbcImport.

- In AbcExport the -renderableOnly flag was doing the opposite of what it was
supposed to do.

- Fix bug in SimpleAbcViewer where XformSchema::getInheritsXforms() was not
being respected.

- Fix bug in AbcStitcher to prevent a segfault.

2011-09-15, Alembic 1.0.1

Hello, Alembic users, we've gotten great feedback from the community
and with their help we've created this collection of small but useful
bug fixes.

Some highlights:

 - A collection of useful bug fixes in the Maya AbcExport and AbcImport
   plugins

 - The renderman procedural has some small bug fixes, e.g. fixes related
   to arbitrary geometric parameters

As always, any files generated by either Alembic 1.0.0 or 
Alembic 1.0.1 will interoperate. If you are working in Maya
we encourage you to look at this update.

##-*****************************************************************************
2011-08-09, Alembic 1.0

Hello, Alembic users, welcome to our first gold release of Alembic.

The complete code changes for this release can be examined here:
http://codereview.appspot.com/4819067/

Some highlights:

 - Addition of the Arnold procedural.

 - Removal of some things that weren't Alembic related (GLUtil)

 - Addition of a python unit test suite for AbcExport and AbcImport.

 - Lots of Houdini SOP improvements.

 - Cleanup of many compiler warnings.

This initial 1.0 version can now be used for critical, deadline-driven
production work.

##-*****************************************************************************
2011-06-28, Alembic 1.0rc1

Hello, Alembic users, welcome to the latest beta version of Alembic.  As we
close in on a 1.0 release, we hope the API and file format are now stable
and fully forwards-compatible.  We consider these to be at a first
"Release Candidate" stage. (note that this doesn't yet apply to the
application-specific reference implementations). As with all pre-release
software, we can't guarantee that changes won't occur between now and a full
1.0 release.

This release is mostly a bugfix and cleanup release.  We've improved the build
support for Windows and OS X, as well as conformed the definitions of the Curves
and NuPatch types more closely to the RI spec.  Those changes, though, do mean
that Curves and NuPatch geometry written out with previous releases will not be
recognized with this release.

The complete code changes for this release can be examined here:

http://codereview.appspot.com/4662068

Some highlights:

 - The flags and arguments for the AbcExport Maya plugin have been updated
   based on feedback from the community, and to be more Maya-idiomatic.
   You can see all the arguments supported by entering "AbcExport -h"
   in the script editor.

 - The Makefile setup for the AlembicIn Houdini SOP is greatly simplified,
   though still not fully integrated with Alembic's CMake setup.

 - The PRMan procedural now supports the Points, NuPatch, Curves, and FaceSet
   types from AbcGeom.

One other important thing to note: previous releases of Alembic did not
require any of the compiled Boost libraries, but going forward, Alembic
requires libboost_thread.

Although this is our initial 1.0 release candidate, it should still be
considered pre-release software, and should not be used for critical, deadline-
driven production work.

##-*****************************************************************************
2011-05-18, Alembic 0.9.3:

The biggest news in this release is what we hope is the complete set of
geometric types for ALembic 1.0, which includes curves (fashioned after
RiCurves), nurbs surfaces, facesets in polygons and subds, and a camera
definition. See http://code.google.com/p/alembic/wiki/Alembic_Geometric_Types
for a complete list.

The complete code changes for this release can be examined here:

http://codereview.appspot.com/4517085

Some highlights:

 - There is now a single class for expression transforms. Preivously
   we had both SimpleXform and Xform objects for expressing transformation.
   The new unified Xform class can be used more simply than the old
   Xform class, while retaining the expressivity of the original.

 - We have experimental support for building Alembic on Windows. Details
   for how to perform the build can found in build/Windows/README.txt and
   build/Windows/WindowsBuildSteps.html

 - We've changed the API in a couple places, most notably, in the way
   instances of the class class Alembic::AbcCoreAbstract::TimeSampling are
   stored and referenced.

 - There is a reference Houdini SOP that can read an entire Alembic archive
   or a subtree of an archive with the option to bake in transformations. As
   such, it could also serve as the "leaf" node for an import process which
   rebuilt the full transformation hierarchy within Houdini. The intention is
   to pair this with a CHOP (not slated for inclusion this round) which extracts
   transformation channels from the archive.  However, it is not yet integrated
   into the Alembic build infrastructure, so compiling it may take some work.

As this is still a 0.9 release, it is still to be considered Beta, and
should not be used for critical, deadline-driven production work.

##-*****************************************************************************

2011-02-17, Alembic 0.9.2:

This is somewhere between a major and minor update.  Numerous bugs
have been fixed, some new functionality has been introduced, and
reference Maya plugins for import and export have been added.

The code changes can be examined here:

http://codereview.appspot.com/4160045/

Some highlights in functionality:

 - Maya export and import plugins are in the top-level "maya" directory.

 - In the top-level "python" directory is the beginning of Python bindings
   using Boost.Python.  This effort is currently incomplete, but with
   these bindings, the structure of an Alembic Archive can be examined.

 - UVs on PolyMeshes and SubD meshes, as well as Normals on PolyMeshes,
   are included in their definition, and can be written and read as
   indexed arrays or expanded, non-indexed arrays, with automatic
   interconversion between the two representations.

As this is still a 0.9 release, it is still to be considered Beta, and
should not be used for critical, deadline-driven production work.

2010-12-13, Alembic 0.9.1:

Just a minor update to enable Alembic on 32-bit systems, along with
getting the code in examples/bin/AbcEcho reasonably working.

2010-12-08, Alembic 0.9.1:

The main things in this release are the addition of a Renderman procedural
plugin, and a bunch of bug fixes.  The example Maya exporter
(AlembicSimpleAbcExport) can be used to create an Alembic file from a Maya
scene, and that Alembic file can be read by the Renderman plugin to create
images, which means that an end-to-end workflow can be achieved.  A complete
overview of the changes to the code is here:

http://codereview.appspot.com/3427045

A summary of the bugs fixed in this change:

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=71

An internal implementation detail that fixed an issue where files created by
the AlembicSimpleAbcExport Maya plugin were invalid.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=118

Another internal implementation bugfix that ensured that certain properties of
a subdivision surface were properly animatable.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=17

Method to return a Property's parent Object simply did not work.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=121

Methods to determine high-level type now more flexible and correct.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=7

Build system improvement; now behaves better when trying to find the Boost
headers and libraries.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=13

A consequence of the bug that was fixed in issue 71.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=123

Alembic was not reading all the required data from an ISimpleXform.


In progress, we have:

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=102

This is an arbitrary transform "stack" type, roughly equivalent to Renderman's
transformation model.  It has per-operation hints that allow it to be
recognized as a transform and mapped directly to another application's
transformation model.  It can also be read and written as a regular 4x4
matrix.

2011-09-15, Alembic 1.0.1

Hello, Alembic users, we've gotten great feedback from the community
and with their help we've created this collection of small but useful
bug fixes.

Some highlights:

 - A collection of useful bug fixes in the Maya AbcExport and AbcImport
   plugins

 - The renderman procedural has some small bug fixes, e.g. fixes related
   to arbitrary geometric parameters

As always, any files generated by either Alembic 1.0.0 or 
Alembic 1.0.1 will interoperate. If you are working in Maya
we encourage you to look at this update.

The complete code changes for this release can be examined here:

2011-08-09, Alembic 1.0

Hello, Alembic users, welcome to our first gold release of Alembic.

The complete code changes for this release can be examined here:
http://codereview.appspot.com/4819067/

Some highlights:

 - Addition of the Arnold procedural.

 - Removal of some things that weren't Alembic related (GLUtil)

 - Addition of a python unit test suite for AbcExport and AbcImport.

 - Lots of Houdini SOP improvements.

 - Cleanup of many compiler warnings.

This initial 1.0 version can now be used for critical, deadline-driven
production work.

2011-06-28, Alembic 1.0rc1

Hello, Alembic users, welcome to the latest beta version of Alembic.  As we
close in on a 1.0 release, we hope the API and file format are now stable
and fully forwards-compatible.  We consider these to be at a first
"Release Candidate" stage. (note that this doesn't yet apply to the
application-specific reference implementations). As with all pre-release
software, we can't guarantee that changes won't occur between now and a full
1.0 release.

This release is mostly a bugfix and cleanup release.  We've improved the build
support for Windows and OS X, as well as conformed the definitions of the Curves
and NuPatch types more closely to the RI spec.  Those changes, though, do mean
that Curves and NuPatch geometry written out with previous releases will not be
recognized with this release.

The complete code changes for this release can be examined here:

http://codereview.appspot.com/4662068

Some highlights:

 - The flags and arguments for the AbcExport Maya plugin have been updated
   based on feedback from the community, and to be more Maya-idiomatic.
   You can see all the arguments supported by entering "AbcExport -h"
   in the script editor.

 - The Makefile setup for the AlembicIn Houdini SOP is greatly simplified,
   though still not fully integrated with Alembic's CMake setup.

 - The PRMan procedural now supports the Points, NuPatch, Curves, and FaceSet
   types from AbcGeom.

One other important thing to note: previous releases of Alembic did not
require any of the compiled Boost libraries, but going forward, Alembic
requires libboost_thread.

Although this is our initial 1.0 release candidate, it should still be
considered pre-release software, and should not be used for critical, deadline-
driven production work.

2011-05-18, Alembic 0.9.3:

The biggest news in this release is what we hope is the complete set of
geometric types for ALembic 1.0, which includes curves (fashioned after
RiCurves), nurbs surfaces, facesets in polygons and subds, and a camera
definition. See http://code.google.com/p/alembic/wiki/Alembic_Geometric_Types
for a complete list.

The complete code changes for this release can be examined here:

http://codereview.appspot.com/4517085

Some highlights:

 - There is now a single class for expression transforms. Preivously
   we had both SimpleXform and Xform objects for expressing transformation.
   The new unified Xform class can be used more simply than the old
   Xform class, while retaining the expressivity of the original.

 - We have experimental support for building Alembic on Windows. Details
   for how to perform the build can found in build/Windows/README.txt and
   build/Windows/WindowsBuildSteps.html

 - We've changed the API in a couple places, most notably, in the way
   instances of the class class Alembic::AbcCoreAbstract::TimeSampling are
   stored and referenced.

 - There is a reference Houdini SOP that can read an entire Alembic archive
   or a subtree of an archive with the option to bake in transformations. As
   such, it could also serve as the "leaf" node for an import process which
   rebuilt the full transformation hierarchy within Houdini. The intention is
   to pair this with a CHOP (not slated for inclusion this round) which extracts
   transformation channels from the archive.  However, it is not yet integrated
   into the Alembic build infrastructure, so compiling it may take some work.

As this is still a 0.9 release, it is still to be considered Beta, and
should not be used for critical, deadline-driven production work.

2011-02-17, Alembic 0.9.2:

This is somewhere between a major and minor update.  Numerous bugs
have been fixed, some new functionality has been introduced, and
reference Maya plugins for import and export have been added.

The code changes can be examined here:

http://codereview.appspot.com/4160045/

Some highlights in functionality:

 - Maya export and import plugins are in the top-level "maya" directory.

 - In the top-level "python" directory is the beginning of Python bindings
   using Boost.Python.  This effort is currently incomplete, but with
   these bindings, the structure of an Alembic Archive can be examined.

 - UVs on PolyMeshes and SubD meshes, as well as Normals on PolyMeshes,
   are included in their definition, and can be written and read as
   indexed arrays or expanded, non-indexed arrays, with automatic
   interconversion between the two representations.

As this is still a 0.9 release, it is still to be considered Beta, and
should not be used for critical, deadline-driven production work.

2010-12-13, Alembic 0.9.1:

Just a minor update to enable Alembic on 32-bit systems, along with
getting the code in examples/bin/AbcEcho reasonably working.

2010-12-08, Alembic 0.9.1:

The main things in this release are the addition of a Renderman procedural
plugin, and a bunch of bug fixes.  The example Maya exporter
(AlembicSimpleAbcExport) can be used to create an Alembic file from a Maya
scene, and that Alembic file can be read by the Renderman plugin to create
images, which means that an end-to-end workflow can be achieved.  A complete
overview of the changes to the code is here:

http://codereview.appspot.com/3427045

A summary of the bugs fixed in this change:

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=71

An internal implementation detail that fixed an issue where files created by
the AlembicSimpleAbcExport Maya plugin were invalid.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=118

Another internal implementation bugfix that ensured that certain properties of
a subdivision surface were properly animatable.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=17

Method to return a Property's parent Object simply did not work.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=121

Methods to determine high-level type now more flexible and correct.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=7

Build system improvement; now behaves better when trying to find the Boost
headers and libraries.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=13

A consequence of the bug that was fixed in issue 71.

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=123

Alembic was not reading all the required data from an ISimpleXform.


In progress, we have:

http://code.google.com/p/alembic/issues/detail?id=102

This is an arbitrary transform "stack" type, roughly equivalent to Renderman's
transformation model.  It has per-operation hints that allow it to be
recognized as a transform and mapped directly to another application's
transformation model.  It can also be read and written as a regular 4x4
matrix.
